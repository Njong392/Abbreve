# HOW TO

## Generate Abbrevs

In your terminal run `compileDb.js`: `node ./compileDb.js`

## Todo

* Integrate current db structure into app's search engine.

  > NOTE: I've decided not to touch the app's search engine now cos we need to discuss first

* Add instructions for contributing in main README.md
* Add caching strategies for searched abbrevs
